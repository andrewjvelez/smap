Day 4 instructions for "Sending email to Service now using Azure" session: 

1. Run "git pull" command in command line - it will pull latest changes from the code repository.
2. Run "pip install requests" command - it will install the library that we want to use for calling Azure function.
3. Import "requests" library to your python script.
4. Update 'piName" variable in your scipt from the pi names list below.
5. Add this line after piName variable in your scipt:
    azureCloudFunctionLink = "https://schroders-learning-pimail.azurewebsites.net/api/sendEmail?piName=" + piName

It will set the Azure Function address to a variable.

6. Remove send mail function in your scipt and add:
    response = requests.get(url = azureCloudFunctionLink)

It will actually use the imported "requests" library to call the Azure Function by the address that we assigned to azureCloudFunctionLink variable.

7. To see the result of the request, print the status code of the response. Status code 200 means that the function call was successfull.
    print("Response: " + str(response.status_code))

8. Run your program and click the button!

Finish! :)
