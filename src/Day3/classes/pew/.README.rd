Instructors notes:

The files in the "pew" folder provide more examples of classes, building
on the "pew" example from Day 2. In these examples, we demonstrate 
inheritance. We create a parent class called Weapon and two child 
classes, RayGun and Club. These each override attributes of the parent
Weapon class. The file "pew2_final.py" shows students

1) How to reference classes that we defined in other files
2) How to instantiate objects
3) How to call methods

Be sure to point out how the methods defined in Weapon are not defined
in the child classes, yet can be called by those objects. 

The Club class is defined in the "sticks.py" file. Also in this file is
the Staff class. This demonstrates that you can have multiple classes in
one file. The "pew2_final.py" file shows how to reference each class 
separately. You can also demonstrate how to import all of the classes
if you wish. 

Note that during the initial session, we did not have time to 
demonstrate these files. However, depending on your pace, you may be
able to.
