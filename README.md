# Introduction 
There are many career paths available in Information Technology, but you wouldn't know it from pop culture. This project exists to shed some light on the variety of skills and tasks that are available for those in IT. The goal is to introduce enterprise IT careers in a project oriented fashion to teenage students. We envision by doing this, we can influence a younger generation to get involved and lend their unique creativity, experience, skills, and perspective to advance technology and help continue the legacy of technological innovation.

This project assumes you have a Raspberry Pi 3B with a basic circuitry kit. 
The Raspberry Pi is a product of the Raspberry Pi Foundation.
While we haven't tested this on other versions of the Pi, they are generally compatible. 
The kit we used is the Adafruit Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Starter Pack. As of July 2019, it can be found at https://www.adafruit.com/product/3058
Learn more about the Raspberry Pi at https://www.raspberrypi.org/.

You can download the latest version of Python from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
An excellent introductory book to Python is PYTHON CRASH COURSE by Eric Matthes from No Starch Press. The ISBN is 978-1-59327-603-4
